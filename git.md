# Here I create some guidelines around how I'm going to use git and github

* I'm going to experiment with when i should create a project vs when I shouldn't

Currently I'm using [Free Parking]() as a repo to test out ideas/projects. 

In the future I might consider creating a new project per idea/project. 

The reason I'm considering this is because projects should stand on their own, but the reason for having one big project is to minimize the amount of dead and useless projects I have on github
