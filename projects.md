# Here I create some guidelines and try to create a workflow to define how projects should be structured.
* I'm going to experiment with when i should create a project vs when I shouldn't

Currently I'm using [Free Parking]() as a repo to test out ideas/projects. 

 The idea now is that when something turns from a code spike to a project, I move the code into its own project.

The reason I'm considering this is because projects should stand on their own, but the reason for having one big project is to minimize the amount of dead and useless projects I have on github.

* code that does something can have its own project

* projects need to have documentation

* documentation > tests > change log; importance in order

*
